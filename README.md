# Pluzzdl

ReplayDlR is a Python script (forked from Pluzzdl) used to fetch free VOD
videos from french TV replay sites like 
- http://pluzz.francetv.fr/
- http://videos.nt1.tv/
- http://videos.tmc.tv/
- http://videos.tf1.fr/
- http://www.hd1.tv/
- (hopefully more to come...)

Note that the video content is only available to users connecting from a
French IP, if you live outside of France, a proxy should be used. See
`proxy_fetch.sh` for an example of how to use a proxy (set to
127.0.0.1:8080 in the proxy example).
